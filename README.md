# Cannon Highlighter
Cannon Highlighter is a plugin for RuneLite. It helps players less familiar with cannon mechanics to ensure they are using it optimally. To support this, Cannon Highlighter highlights NPCs when they are able to be hit twice by the cannon, and when they aren't able to be hit at all.
