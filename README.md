# Cannon Highlighter Plugin
Cannon Highlighter is a plugin for RuneLite. It helps players less familiar with cannons ensure they are using it optimally. To support this, Cannon Highlighter highlights NPCs when they are able to be hit twice by the cannon, and when they aren't able to be hit at all.

## Configuration
Users can configure the following:
* Draw Status Names (on/off)
* Highlight Hull (on/off)
* Highlight South West Tile (on/off)
* Show Hit Zones (on/off)
* Unhittable Color (color)
* Double hit Color (color)
* Single hit Color (color)
